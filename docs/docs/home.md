### Nightly created to Connect ###

**Nightly Connect** is an easy and user friendly way to connect applications with client's wallet. Scan, connect and approve. In these few steps the application is connected to the wallet.

Secure way to communicate between wallets and dapps.
Nightly Connect can be easily adapted on any blockchain. Right now we are supporting wallets on Near and Solana.

:::

Nightly Connect is a remote signer protocol which communicates securely between dapps and web3 wallets. The protocol establishes a remote pairing between two dapps and/or devices. Payloads are encrypted through a shared sessionId between the two sides. The connection is initiated by one peer displaying a QR Code and is established when the counter-party approves the request.
